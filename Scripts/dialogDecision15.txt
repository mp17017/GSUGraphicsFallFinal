John runs through the container and out the back, shutting the door and barring it behind him.

The monster chases after him, but slams against the locked door of the container.

Before the monster can recover, John quickly runs around the side and shuts the container from the other side, locking it in.

ENDING 4:
You trapped the monster and saved the child!

John leads the child outside the office, to a window around the corner behind a
nearby container, then opens the window.

John looks around for the creature, with it nowhere to be seen.
John: "It must've found something that caught its interest, lets hope that isn't us."
John: "Alright, it’s clear come'on."

John helps the child out the window and follows them out.

ENDING 3:
You found the child and escaped without defeating the monster.
Capturing that thing is someone else’s problem.

VICTORY

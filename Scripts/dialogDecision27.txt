John opens the door, and quickly puts the key into the ignition.
The vehicle sputters a few times before going silent again.
John attempts to turn the vehicle over again, but the vehicle refuses to start.

The skittering gets loader as what looks like an oversized, mutated crab skitters around the corner.
As the creature rounds the corner into view, it lets out a blood-curdling screech.
It lurches towards the vehicle with frightening speed.

John: "Come on! Why won't it start!?"

The monster crashes through the window and attacks John.

John Died

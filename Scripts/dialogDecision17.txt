John knocks on the door to attempt getting a response.

John: "Hello? Anyone home?"

The knocking attracts the attention of the monster.
As it begins hunting, it lets out a loud, high-pitched screech.
Seeing John from the nearby lot, the creature breaks through the nearby window and attacks him.

John Died

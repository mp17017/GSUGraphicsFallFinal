John breaks the window and opens the door, and quickly searches for the key.

The skittering gets louder as what looks like an oversized, mutated crab skitters around the corner.
As the creature rounds the corner into view, it lets out a blood-curdling screech.
It lurches towards the vehicle with frightening speed.

John: “Come on! Where are they!?”

The monster leaps through the broken window and attacks John.

John Died

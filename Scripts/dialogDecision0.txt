Narrator: You are John Brooks, a 32-year-old private eye.
You have been paid to search for a couples lost son
The child went missing at the docks a few days ago after deboarding a cruise.
The docks are rife with thugs and illegal dealings.
With the police firmly in the local crime rings pocket...
You won't be counting on any help from the cops.

Your usual informant isn't being any help either.
It's safe to assume there's mafia involvement in this case.
You'll have to tread carefully on this job.
Getting mixed up with the local crime syndicate spells bad news for a simple PE.

You grab your trusty revolver, and head out to the local smuggling area:
an officially abandoned warehouse on the docks, often used to keep "unwanted eyes" off illegal goods.

Arriving at the warehouse, you take a look around for any posted watchmen.

John: "My gut tells me he’s in here… somewhere…"
John: "Nobody would be dumb enough to anger the mafia around here."
John: "Looks like they didn't bother posting any guards at the entrance."

John: "Now, where to look first?"

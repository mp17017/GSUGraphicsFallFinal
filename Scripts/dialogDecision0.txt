Narrator: You are Johnathan Brooks, a 32-year-old private eye.
You have been paid to search for a couples lost son,
they went missing at the docks a few days ago after they left a cruise.
The docks are riff with thugs and illegal dealings.
With the police firmly in the local crime rings pocket,
they won’t be doing anything about it anytime soon.

Narrator: You grab your trusty revolver, and head out to the docks
where the child was last seen.

Johnathan: “My gut tells me he’s in here… somewhere… it’s late,
so I shouldn’t find anyone else here.”

Johnathan: “Now, where to look first?”

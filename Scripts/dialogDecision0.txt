Narrator: You are Johnathan Brooks, a 32-year-old private eye.
You have been paid to search for a couples lost son,
they went missing at the docks a few days ago after they left a cruise.
The docks are riff with thugs and illegal dealings.
With the police firmly in the local crime rings pocket,
they won’t be doing anything about it anytime soon.

You grab your trusty revolver, and head out to the docks
where the child was last seen.

JB: “My gut tells me he’s in here… somewhere… it’s late,
so I shouldn’t find anyone else here.”

JB: “Now, where to look first?”
